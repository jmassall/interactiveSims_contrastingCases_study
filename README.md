# Evaluating pedagogical approaches for teaching students how to learn by inquiry

This repo contains Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing anonymized data collected during a study on inquiry learning.  Students in a first-year physics course were given multiple inquiry activities where they had to uncover a rule for a certain physics topic (before any lecture material on the subject).  There were two different sorts of inquiry activities depending on which condition students were in: 

* **SIM**:  Students explore an interactive simulation to generate contrasting observations that they then use to create their rule.

* **DATA**:  Students were provided with a curated set of observations that they then compared and contrasted to create their rule.
